## List of features for Firefox 70

## List of features for Firefox 70



- Firefox can now [suggest securely generated passwords](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Toolkit:Password_Manager/Password_Generation#Firefox_70_.28Desktop_only.29) from the context menu and autocomplete (on supported sites).

- The password manager interface (about:logins) was entirely redesigned based on the [Firefox Lockwise](https://lockwise.firefox.com/) extension.

- [Aliased theme properties have been removed](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/07/25/upcoming-deprecations-in-firefox-70/), which may affect some themes.

- The Firefox Accounts toolbar menu has been updated and reorganised to give faster access to account features and services.

- One of the most amazing features of Firefox 70 is the ability to pause on DOM mutation in the debugger. Once a DOM mutation breakpoint is set, you’ll see it listed under  "DOM Mutation Breakpoints" in the right-hand pane of the Debugger; this  is also where you’ll see breaks reported.

- One of the other amazing features of Firefox 70 which is related to the developer console is - Inactive CSS rules indicator in rules panel.

  Inactive CSS properties in the Rules view of the Page Inspector are now colored gray and have an information icon displayed next to them. The properties are technically valid, but won’t have any effect on the element. When you hover over the info icon, you’ll see a useful message about why the CSS is not being applied, including a hint about how to fix the problem and a “Learn more” link for more information.

  

  For example, in this case our grid-auto-columns property is inactive because we are trying to apply it to an element that is not a grid container:

Here is a list of features that will be [deprecated in Firefox 70](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/07/25/upcoming-deprecations-in-firefox-70/). Also Mozilla called [Firefox 70 as a Bountiful relase for all](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/firefox-70-a-bountiful-release-for-all/)

If you are not a Firefox user yet, it's time to **Go Firefox**!
