## List of features for Firefox 70

- Firefox can now [suggest securely generated passwords](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Toolkit:Password_Manager/Password_Generation#Firefox_70_.28Desktop_only.29) from the context menu and autocomplete (on supported sites).
- The password manager interface (about:logins) was entirely redesigned based on the [Firefox Lockwise](https://lockwise.firefox.com/) extension.
- [Aliased theme properties have been removed](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/07/25/upcoming-deprecations-in-firefox-70/), which may affect some themes.
- The Firefox Accounts toolbar menu has been updated and reorganized to give faster access to account features and services.
