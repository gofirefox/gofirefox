ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, it's great to have you here.

We know that first impressions are important. This is the first one, not so great to start with! But, I assure you the one's that come next will surely be great!

**A few things you should know upfront**:

1. GoFirefox is a website started by me to promote users to use Firefox and have a more secure browsing experience. Privacy matters.
2. I am planning to write about - Firefox, Opensource Web projects, JavaScript, Firefox(or OSS) Products.
3. I respect everyone's opinions. But, Opinions are my own.
