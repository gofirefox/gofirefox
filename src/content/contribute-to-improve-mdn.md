MDN is one of the world's largest Web tutorial and documentation platform. It's so high on content that companies like Google and Microsoft have come to terms to aggregate the documentation of Web on MDN.

All parts of MDN (docs and the site itself) are created by an open community of developers. Please join MDN! Let's try to help make Web better by contributing to MDN.

   **Types of tasks you can do-**

   - You can help review or edit existing docs, and apply correct tags to them.
   - We need more code samples! You can also help build our site platform, [Kuma](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Kuma)!
   - We have tasks that require both technical and language skills, like  writing new articles, reviewing for technical accuracy, or adapting  documents.
   - All localization and translation work done on MDN is done by our amazing community of volunteers.
   - You can report problems by [filing a documentation issue](https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/new?template=issue-template.md).
