## What exactly is a data breach?

A data breach happens when personal or private information of us gets stolen without permission because of a lot of reasons - it may be because of a hacker taking away your data, poor security of webapps/database, employee or others stealing it, etc., A data breach can also happen by accident like if someone's login credentials accidentally get posted publicly in places like GitHub or Pastebin etc.,

## How to check if you have been hacked?

- ### [Firefox Monitor](https://monitor.firefox.com/)

- ### [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)

## Will Firefox Monitor save you from a Hack?

No! Firefox or any company will not prevent data breaches from happening. They alert you from breaches that affect you as soon as they happen, so you can take the next step of protecting or fighting quickly. If a breach involved financial information, you'll also need to monitor your own financial accounts and credit reports for anything suspicious.

Take care folks! Stay safe :)
